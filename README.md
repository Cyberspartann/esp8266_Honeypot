ESP8266 Honeypot: The Ultimate Wi-Fi Network Interceptor & Device Monito

ESP8266 Honeypot is an advanced device designed to intercept Wi-Fi network traffic and monitor devices. It captures login credentials, device information, and network details by mimicking popular login pages (like Google’s). It records sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, MAC addresses, device types, signal strength (RSSI), and more.

The device offers a real-time admin panel to monitor all connected devices, login attempts, and analyze captured data. Whether you are a security researcher or network administrator, the ESP8266 Honeypot gives you deep insights into every device connected to your network.



Key Features:

Wi-Fi Network Interception:

Login Data Capture: Safely intercepts login credentials (username, password) from devices attempting to connect to the Wi-Fi network, providing valuable data for network analysis.


Device Monitoring:

MAC Address & Device Info: Records detailed device information, including MAC addresses, device types (e.g., Android, iOS, Windows), and connection times.

Signal Strength (RSSI): Displays real-time signal strength for each device, helping identify weak or strong connections and potential issues.


Real-Time Admin Panel:

User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive admin panel lets you view captured login attempts, detailed device data, and connection status in real-time.

Connected Devices Overview: See all devices connected to your network, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and device types (with fallback RSSI for unidentified devices).


Advanced Login Page Customization:

Google Login Mimicry: The device presents a Google-style login page designed to capture user credentials when devices attempt to log in.


Customizable Device Data Recording:

Device Types & Signal Range: Automatically categorizes devices based on signal strength, such as "Nearby," "Medium Range," or "Far Device," even if the exact device type can’t be identified.


Cross-Platform Compatibility:

Works on Various Devices: The device is compatible with various platforms, supporting Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux.




Perfect For:

Security Researchers: Track and analyze login attempts and device behavior on networks.

Network Administrators: Gain deep visibility into who’s connected to your network and monitor devices in real-time.

Educational Purposes: Learn more about network security and the potential vulnerabilities of Wi-Fi networks.
